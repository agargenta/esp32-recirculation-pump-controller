# ESP32 Recirculation Pump Controller

## About

An ESP32-compatible controller that turns a "dumb" hot-water re-circulation pump into a "smart" one.
The pump is turned on demand (e.g. someone calls for hot water by turning on a faucet), and turned
off automatically after the water in the pipes is deemed hot enough, or after a timeout.
